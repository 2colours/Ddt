# Thoughts

Just some random thoughts which should be taken with a grant of salt.

## Ddt should:
1. play well with other tools and try to integrate in existing workflows as long
   as it makes sense i.e. through using vcs hooks to auto commit autogenrated
   changes.
2. keep all the autogenerated changes to be commited to the minimum for
   the currently commited code.
3. if possible allow the human to edit and test autogenerated code to be
   commited.
4. make it hard to do stupid things:
  - Example: use .gitignore to hide generated files to prevent them beeing
    accidentally commited
5. Try to enforce best practices, but allow people to customize their workflows
   as long as it's not completly overkill and a burden.
6. Should run as much as possible in parallel.
7. Mark files generated during build / install with a distribution installer as
   autogenerated so a human reading such a file knows where it's coming
   from.


## Workflows

### Project creation

- make directories
- generate META6
- generate README
- generate a class/module/package
- generate licensing stuff
- initialize VCS Repository

### Patching installed Distributions
 - You install `App-Bar`
 - `App-Bar` depends on `Net::Foo::Client`, `Net::Foo::TLS`.
 - You start using `App-Bar` you notice that you are missing some feature
 - Here you have two scenarios
#### Perfect World
* Your distribution manager (i.e: zef or panda)
  - already has the source of `App-Bar` (because it's part of the dist pkg)
* You edit the source code of the `App-Foo` distribution like it would be a
  locally checked out project in $EDITOR. Your editor should interact with with
  the distribution by running tests ect.
* Once you are happy with your changes a new branch is created and your
  distribution manager starts using this branch for your environment
* Once you think it's stable you can easily do a PR

#### Current Situation
* Stupid Approach
  - Find `zef locate App-Bar`
  - open in editor
  - hack
  - run manual some tests
  - OUTCOME: Lost at next upgrade or forgotten and never merged with upstream

* Invalid Approaches
  - Using `zef look App-Foo` it will drop you in a directory without any
    version control

* Sensible Approach
  - get Source-url from `zef info App-Foo`
  - Hope it's some kind of version control url
  - do vcs clone source-url
  - HACK
  - run `zef test`, `prove`, `prove6` or whatever is suitable for current case
  - do vcs commit when ready
  - use `zef --force install .` to deploy when ready
  - fork the github repo (i.e: via `hub` `git fork`)
  - make a pr (i.e. via `hub` `git pr`)
    * Pr is accepted for the current distribution version
    * Pr needs to be rebased on the current master
    * Not accepted: create an own `App::Foo:auth(user):ver(X.Y.Z)` which
     emulates `App::Foo:ver(X.Y.Z)`. Release new Distribution and may the fork be
     with you!

The **Sensible Approach** has three phases:
 - get version controlled source code for a unit name so you can comfortably
 edit it with your `$EDITOR`
 - hacking / testing
 - deploying and maintaining own set of patches on top of the distribution
 - distributing changes

### Adding an executable script to the current distribution

## How to handle Meta distributions?

Currently it's a custom(?) in the Perl world to generate different distributions
from one source and upload them separately to CPAN. This solves a number of
issues:

1. A huge source code repository which is split in different distributions
   modules. This allows applications to only pull a minimal set of dependencies.
2. From same source repository multiple distribution versions could be
   generated. This helps to maintain multiple API versions.

My current issue with that is it makes it harder for the user to contribute back
to the project in a way described in **Sensible Aproach** because:

- You need all the source code from which the distribution is
generated, which may be not deployed on your system. This might be an issue if
you have no network connection at the moment. It enforces the human to fall
back to the **Stupid Aproach**
- Let's hope the distribution authors thought about adding all the relevant
tests to the distribution from the main source repository. This might be not
an issue if the distribution is generated with a smart tool.
- How do you integrate with the currently cripled non cpan infrastructure?
- How to build the distribution locally and install it with zef?

# How to handle different unit versions in the source repository

### Issues
- Should they be packaged as separate minimal distributions? If so how to
contribute back to the user?
- Currently perl6 doesn't provide a way to separate between source code for
distribution and project vcs repository. 

### Current Sollution
Use vcs branch / tag feature


## ROAD MAP

* [ ] Refactor generation functions out of Ddt::Distribution
* [ ] Use git-hooks
* [ ] Implement Rule 2 from above

## Random Examples

- A function is add to the code and is commited. The post-commit ddt hook is
run, in this example it generates some pod data which needs to be commited.
There're two cases to handle:
  1. If a human is present—i.e if running from a tty device—present him witht
     the posibillity to edit the autogenerated code to be commited.
  2. There is no human supervision so just do what needs to be done
